Aim:
1) A Project to get comfortable with R and using the Twitter/Google geocoding API.

2) Deploy a Shiny R web app.


Description: The project is divided into 3 parts:-
Part1: Creating simple graphs in R using a small amount of data and inbuilt datasets like 'mtcars'.

Part2: To extract data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and recreate their graphs using R.

Part3: To use Twitter's API t collect tweets related to the word flu and create a heatmap of the locations with maximum tweets. The aim is to compare the data collected to CDC's data by creating a heatmap of the same.
Finally, the results are deployed using Shiny R.

This was a Project undertaken by Himanshu Garg and me, Shreyas Narasimha as an academic project at The University at Buffalo - State University of New York.
